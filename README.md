## Skills & Experience

### Web Security & Pentesting  
- Expert knowledge of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities including advanced attack vectors: RCE, CSRF, XSS, IDOR, SQLi, JWT token manipulation and exploitation.  
- Developed and executed complex web application exploitation scenarios.  
- Strong understanding of HTTP/HTTPS, FTP/SFTP protocols, HSTS and cookie security (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite).  
- Practical experience bypassing Content Security Policy (CSP) and other defense mechanisms.

### Cryptography & Data Security  
- Hands-on work with modern algorithms: Argon2d, Blowfish, bcrypt, scrypt.  
- Analysis and implementation of secure hashing functions and authentication systems.  
- Cryptanalysis and vulnerability research on proprietary and third-party solutions.

### Tools & Technologies  
- Professional use of OSINT tools: Hydra, Sherlock, Maigret, and others for information gathering.  
- Deep experience with pentesting and analysis tools: objdump, Nmap (including all flags and extensions), RustScan.  
- Automated and custom scripting in Python, Go, and Bash for efficient testing workflows.  
- Binary analysis and vulnerability research at low-level.

### Programming Languages  
- Development and code review in Go, Python, C++, JavaScript.  
- Prototype exploit and utility development.  
- Understanding of cryptographic libraries internals and algorithms.

### Practical Experience & Achievements  
- Competed in challenging CTF teams on TryHackMe, Hack The Box — placed in top 10% among hundreds of participants (ranked 730 in major Industrial Intrusion challenge).  
- Delivered successful authorized attacks (RCE, JWT token manipulation, CSP bypass) during security assessments.  
- Conducted reconnaissance operations using Hydra and other advanced OSINT tools including social engineering aspects.  
- In-depth analysis and exploitation of JWT vulnerabilities, implementing secure authentication mechanisms.  
- Created and maintained custom utilities to automate security testing and data collection.
